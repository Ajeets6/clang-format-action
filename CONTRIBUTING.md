# Testing your contribution:

The GitHub Actions [Build and Test workflow](https://github.com/jidicula/clang-format-action/actions/workflows/dockerimage.yml) is triggered on PR submission. It runs [`test/docker-run-test.sh`](https://github.com/jidicula/clang-format-action/blob/main/test/docker-run-test.sh) on the [test files](https://github.com/jidicula/clang-format-action/tree/main/test). Run this script locally to test your changes. If you're adding checking functionality for new file extensions, add test files that are known to pass this Action's check and known to fail this Action's check, in `test/known_pass` and `test/known_fail` respectively.
